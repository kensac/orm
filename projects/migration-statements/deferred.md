# Deferred — Migration statements

Items found during delivery that are out of the current slice's scope. Each names where it came from and what would resolve it. Transient; migrated or dropped at close-out.

## A model that keeps its name but changes its table (`@@map`) has no statement

**Found:** slice 1, dispatch 4 review (2026-10-06).

A user keeps `model User` and changes `@@map("users")` to `@@map("app_users")`. The diff shows a dropped table and a created one, exactly like a rename, but there is no model rename to state: `--rename User:User` is unresolved because the new name already exists in the origin. In `migration plan` the user can write `this.renameTable({ table: 'users', to: 'app_users' })` by hand; in `db update` there is no way to avoid the drop and create. Slice 1 refuses a field statement on such a model with `statementRejected` (D4-1) so it never plans a column rename on a table the diff then drops.

**Options:** let a same-coordinate model statement (`--rename User:User`) mean "this model's storage was renamed"; or add a storage-level statement; or accept the hand-written route for this case. Decide with the operator before slice 2 writes the refusal text, because the refusal will otherwise suggest a `--rename` that cannot resolve.

## A model move across namespaces (`auth.User:public.User`)

**Found:** slice 1, dispatch 3 (2026-10-06). Resolves but is refused with `statementRejected`; needs a `set schema` operation with its working-schema step and companion names. Scheduled for slice 3 with the namespace renames (recorded in `plan.md`).
